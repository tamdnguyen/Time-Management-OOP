Ability to name the activities freely and to choose the activity to start the timer for. The purpose of the timer is to stop on command, not after a set amount of time.

The activities have a time evaluation (estimated duration for the task) which should be viewable if wanted ( e.g., by Finnish credits: 27h = 1 credit, by days: 24h = 1 day).

The user can move to the next day on command.

The program saves all time spent on activities and exports into a file. 

Users can print the current day’s spent time and times saved into a file (the program needs to be able to read the file). 

The print also shows used time in comparison to tasks’ time evaluation in percentage value (at least while printing from file).

The program assumes when running that it has not been used before and starts a new day. The program only needs to read a file when previous time management data are printed, and even then it doesn’t have to seperate today’s saved data from previous saved data.
