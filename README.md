# Time management OOP

## Checkpoint 1 - 25.03.2022

Some main classes have been implemented. Code can be found in folder Code
from the project page.

## Current properties

Some main classes of the program has been implemented:
- `Activity` class
- `Timer` class
- `Date` class
- `TimeConversion` class

Currently, the program can create the tasks and track its time. However,
the time tracking is still not automatic, I could only test the tracking
feature using `time.sleep()` function.

The time display can also be chosen by the users. There are currently
4 different choices of time display.


## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? No. However, a main function
can be written to run the program at the most basic level (i.e., add activities
, automatically track time of the activities, choose different time display)
 - How is the program executed? For the most basic execution of the program,
a very simple `main` function has been written. This function creates a task,
and track its time using the `time.sleep()` function. To execute this `main`,
go to folder Code, run the file `main.py`

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far? More than three full days
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems? At first, I was lost at implementing the main classes
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan?
 
## What to do next?

- [ ] Import/Export the time management data
- [x] ~~Unittest~~
- [ ] GUI | Connect to the backend + Main workflow
- [ ] Pomodoro and reminder to take a break | Modify the return and workflow
- [ ] Moving to next day function [?]
- [ ] Choose the day to show function
- [ ] Loading a file to the program function [?]
- [x] ~~Edit and Delete function~~

## Some current limitation (bugs) of the app

At the moment, the app still has some small limitations that can be noticed during the use (it does not work perfectly as the apps on the market). However, many improvements can be made to the app in the future. Some of the limitations that have been noticed so far include:
- User creates 2 activities with the same name is now still possible in the app. One improvement can be creating a pop up windows to ask if the person wants to rename the activity or not.
