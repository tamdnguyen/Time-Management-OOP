# Time management OOP

## Checkpoint 1 - 25.03.2022

Some main classes have been implemented. Code can be found in folder Code
from the project page.

## Current properties

Some main classes of the program has been implemented:
- `Activity` class
- `Timer` class
- `Date` class
- `TimeConversion` class

Currently, the program can create the tasks and track its time. However,
the time tracking is still not automatic, I could only test the tracking
feature using `time.sleep()` function.

The time display can also be chosen by the users. There are currently
4 different choices of time display.


## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? No. However, a main function
can be written to run the program at the most basic level (i.e., add activities
, automatically track time of the activities, choose different time display)
 - How is the program executed? For the most basic execution of the program,
a very simple `main` function has been written. This function creates a task,
and track its time using the `time.sleep()` function. To execute this `main`,
go to folder Code, run the file `main.py`

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far? More than three full days
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems? At first, I was lost at implementing the main classes
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan?
 
## What to do next?

- [ ] Import/Export the time management data
- [ ] Unittest
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Pomodoro and reminder to take a break
- [ ] Moving to next day function [?]
- [ ] Loading a file to the program function [?]
